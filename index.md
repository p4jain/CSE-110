# Parshva Jain

I will start with a little but about myself. My name is Parshva Jain and I am currently a junior at UCSD studying Computer Science. Some of my favorite things are as follows:
- Working Out
- Going on long walks
- Spending quality time with my friends

My favorite places that I have visited are as follows:
1. Switzerland
2. UAE
3. Hong Kong
4. Italy

My friends often describe me as:
```
An old man
```

My favorite programming language is **Python** because it is dynamically typed

It wasnt for 
```
System.out.println()
```
I don't know how I would be able to debug my code
